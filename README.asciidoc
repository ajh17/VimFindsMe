__light-weight, "fuzzy", &path dependent file browser for Vim on *nix__

TIP: If you like VimFindsMe and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for

[NOTE]
====
* Depends on the system `find` command (and would therefore
  probably not work on Windows)

* Ignores ".git" directories by default.

* Ignores Vim swap files by default and is configurable via
  `g:vfm_ignore_extensions`

:VFM
~~~~

The ++:VFM++ command does a system `find` within the paths in your
&path option and displays the results in a scratch buffer. Press
<enter> on a file in this browser buffer to open it in the current
window. Press ``q'' to quit the browser buffer without making a file
selection.

By default, VFM uses `<leader><tab>` to launch its browser. This can
be overridden through the <plug>vfm_browse map.

See the documentation for more details.
